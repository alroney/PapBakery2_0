//TODO - add a function that will calculate the price per gram of a recipe. 
// Then use that to calculate the price of a treat (using the unbaked weight of the treat).
// Once the price per treat is calculated, I may add an addition % to the price.
// This is to account for weight loss during baking, since I will weighing the treats after
// they're baked to package them appropriately.
